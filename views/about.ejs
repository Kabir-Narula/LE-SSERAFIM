            <p class="fw-medium fs-5">LE SSERAFIM is a girl group with SOURCE MUSIC, a label under HYBE, consisting of five members of different nationalities:
                SAKURA, KIM CHAEWON, HUH YUNJIN, KAZUHA and HONG EUNCHAE. The first girl group to launch through a collaboration between 
                HYBE and SOURCE MUSIC, they are taking a daring stance and saying right from the outset that they will stand at the very top.
                The group’s name, LE SSERAFIM, is an anagram of the words “I’M FEARLESS.” The name captures the group’s self-confidence and 
                iron will as they go out into the world fearlessly and unwavering before the watchful eyes of the world. It is like an incantation 
                to guarantee their success on the merit of their unbreakable poise and strength.</p>

                                    FEARLESS, the debut album from LE SSERAFIM, the group courageously singing out to the world
                                    Join a group of girls following their hearts as they set out on a journey never undertaken by anyone before</p>
                                <p>
                                    LE SSERAFIM's FEARLESS tells the story of a group of girls whose dream of reaching the top leads them on a never-before-undertaken journey.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As the world looks toward LE SSERAFIM’s debut, the group stands up against their expectations rather than bowing down before them.
                                    They say the worst thing you can do is to get tied up in the past and lose yourself, but the most valuable thing is to stay true to 
                                    yourself and pursue your dreams. As they set out for new horizons, LE SSERAFIM couldn’t care less about the way the world sees them.
                                    They choose the future, not the past; not to sink, but to soar.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are five songs on the album: “The World Is My Oyster,” which serves as an introduction to the album as the girls sing of their ambition 
                                    to do things their way in three different languages; the title song, “FEARLESS”; “Blue Flame,” which uses fascinating blue fireflies as a symbol of 
                                    a desire to set out on an adventure into the unknown; a reinterpretation of The Little Mermaid through the eyes LE SSERAFIM in “The Great Mermaid”; 
                                    and “Sour Grapes,” a song about naive yet selfish attitude toward love and based on Aesop’s fable The Fox and the Grapes.

                                        “We Can’t Be Broken”: How LE SSERAFIM Faces Adversities </p>
                                    <p>
                                        LE SSERAFIM is back, and they’re raising their voices louder and stronger than ever to stand up against everything life can throw at them. <br>
                                        The group’s new album opens with their infallibility guarantee, “The Hydra,” followed by the title track, “ANTIFRAGILE,” that reveals the kind of strength 
                                        of character that lets them repurpose hardship as an impetus for growth. Midway through the mini album, “Impurities” shows that the girls embrace everything
                                        about themselves, wounds and all, while “No Celestial” signals their intention to shed away images of angel wings in favor of living a down-to-earth life like 
                                        everyone else. Rounding off their sophomore release is “Good Parts (where the quality is bad but I am),” an ode to the imperfect, sometimes pedestrian traits 
                                        that make up a part of who we all are. </p>
                                    <p> Equally impressive is the album cover, a visual representation of the messages explored throughout ANTIFRAGILE. </p>
                                    <p> The design features gold crevices running across a black background, a nod to kintsugi art and its method of accepting the imperfections of broken ceramics 
                                        by preserving the telltale signs of their fragility. Outside forces bent on breaking the mind are ultimately no match for the members of LE SSERAFIM, who will 
                                        continue to hold each other up until they become an even better version of themselves.
                                    </p>

                                    LE SSERAFIM’s first studio album one year into their debut, collaborating with a world-class musician!
                                    “We don’t care what other people think.” Lead single “UNFORGIVEN (feat. Nile Rodgers)” </p>
                                <p>
                                    LE SSERAFIM’s first studio album entitled UNFORGIVEN is released on May 1.
                                    LE SSERAFIM (KIM CHAEWON, SAKURA, HUH YUNJIN, KAZUHA, HONG EUNCHAE) told stories as only they could 
                                    through their two mini albums FEARLESS and ANTIFRAGILE that were released last year. </p> 
                                <p>
                                    The members candidly expressed their desires to become the best in FEARLESS, and resolved to grow and become even stronger as they encounter hardships 
                                    in ANTIFRAGILE. In their first studio album UNFORGIVEN, they portray their will to pave their own way, paying no mind to what others think.
                                    The five members declare that they will march ahead in the direction they see fit, freeing themselves from others’ standards in song.
