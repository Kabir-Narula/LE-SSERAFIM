#Levi's Side Project Website
Welcome to the repository for my side project website dedicated to Levi! This project showcases my skills in CSS and JavaScript while paying tribute to the iconic Levi's brand. Below, you'll find an overview of the CSS styles and JavaScript functionalities used in this project.

#CSS Styles
The CSS file for this project (styles.css) contains various styles that contribute to the visual design and responsiveness of the website. Here are some key styles used:

#Background Styling:

*The background image is set to cover the entire viewport with object-fit: cover.
*The background brightness is adjusted using the filter property.

*Header Bar:
**The navigation bar (headerBar) is styled to have a semi-transparent black background.
**The logo and navigation links are positioned using flexbox.

Logo Styling:
*The logo (logoContainer) consists of text and an image.
The logo text has uppercase formatting, font adjustments, and letter spacing.
Navigation Links:

Navigation links (link) are styled with a gradient hover effect and animation.
Dropdown content (dropdownContent) is displayed when hovering over certain links.
Responsive Design:

The layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
Certain elements' sizes and margins are adjusted for better visibility on smaller devices.
JavaScript Functionalities
The JavaScript file (main.js) provides interactivity and enhances the user experience on the website. Here are some of the functionalities implemented:

Audio Control:

The background music can be controlled using the audioController function.
The audio controller image changes dynamically based on audio playback status.
Mobile Menu:

The mobile menu button (menuHamburger) triggers the opening and closing of the right sidebar (rightBarStuff).
The menu button icon also transitions into an "X" when the menu is open.
Dropdown Content:

Hovering over specific links displays a dropdown content (dropdownContent) with additional information.
Responsive Design Handling:

Media queries are used to adjust the layout and functionality for different screen sizes.
